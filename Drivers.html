    <h6>Personally I think Logan Sargeant will end the drivers championship in 20th this is because he did not perform very well last year and came 21st in the championship last year with the only other driver below him not being in Formula 1 this year.</h6>
    <h3>P19 Estaban Ocon</h3>

    <h6>This desicion is pretty bold but I think that alpine is going to be very weak this season as they are under a new team princapal and the car looked terrible in Bahrain</h6>
    <h3>P18 Pierre Gasly</h3>

    <h6>As with Ocon I think that Alpine is going to be very weak this season as it was a P19 and P20 qualifying for the alpines and they did not place much better only overtaking Bottas who had a pit issue and Logan Sargeant who crashed off</h6>
    <h3>P17 Valtteri Bottas</h3>

   <h6> I do not think Stake F1 is going to be a extremly competitive team this year. Also I think that Bottas may retire this season as Carlos Sainz may take his seat. This is all combined with Zhou having better race pace in bahrain </h6>
   <h3> P16 Zhou Guanyu </h3>

   <h6>I feel like the Stake car is not going to be competitive this year due to the fact that is is kind of in a transition phase between being alfa romeo and audi so I do not think it will be the strongest. Despite this I think that Zhou will do better then Bottas overall</h6>
    <h3>P15 Kevin Magnussen</h3>

    <h6>I feel that Magnussen is going to do slightly better this season as the haas is not going to be the worst car by far but I still think that Magnussen is not going to do that well as he was knocked out in Q2 in Bahrain compared to his teamate who got to Q3  </h6>
    <h3>P14 Nico Hulkenberg</h3>

<h6>I feel like the Haas will be slightly more even and slightly more competitive this season so I think this is a reasonable place to put Hulkenberg</h6>
<h3>P13 Yuki Tsunoda</h3>

<h6>Looking at Bahrain it looks like the RBs are not going to be very competiitive. I also feel even though Yuki has qualified better Riccardo is going to be more consistent with race pace</h6> 
<h3>P12 Alexander Albon</h3>

<h6>I feel that Albon will do similar to last year as the car is looking pretty ok</h6>
<h3>P11 Lance Stroll</h3>

<h3>P10 Daniel Riccardo</h3>

<h6>The reason I have placed him so far above his teamate even though they have been relativly equal is I think there might be a chance a slight chance that he might be promoted up to red bull if Perez stops performing at the end of the season</h6>
<h3>P9 Fernando Alonso</h3>

<h6>The Aston Martin has not been as strong in Bahrain this year as it was last year. And due to the start of the season being where Aston Martin got the most points last year. So unless they improve throughout the year I can not see Alonso getting higher then P9 even though he is an amzing driver</h6>
<h3>P8 Lewis Hamilton</h3>

<h6>It saddens me to say this is where I feel Hamilton is going to end up this season. This is due to the Mercedes not being that great this year and particuarly for Lewis as George has been able to get something out of the car</h6>
<h3>P7 Oscar Piastri </h3>

<h6>The Mclarens have looked a lot stronger this season as well as the Aston Martins being no where near where they were last season so I think that Piastri will be able to get a solid P7 in the Championship</h6>
<h3>P6 George Russell</h3>

<h6>I feel like mercedes is not going to be that strong this season as Hamilton has lost faith in the team and is moving to Ferrari. In Bahrain Russell did much better then hamilton so that is why I have placed Geroge above Hamilton</h6>
<h3>P5 Lando Norris </h3>

<h6>I feel like Mclaren is going to be strong this year but not as strong as Red Bull or Ferrari so I think this is where Lando will end up</h6>
<h3>P4 Charles Leclerc</h3>
<image src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Formel12021-SchlossGabelhofen%2807%29.jpg"/>

<h6>I feel that Charles will probably end up here this season. Just due to the fact that the drivers above him have their reasons for getting more points this season</h6>
<h3>P3 Sergio Perez</h3>
<image src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Sergio_Perez_April_2016.jpg"/>
<p>Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons</p>
<h6>I feel that Perez may fall off towards the end of the season and could possibly be demoted to RB this season so this is why I have put him here despite what he did in Bahrain</h6>
<h3>P2 Carlos Sainz</h3>
<image src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Formel12021-SchlossGabelhofen%2815%29.jpg"/>

<h6>I feel like Carlos is the better driver at Ferrari but Ferrari generally tends to prioritize Leclerc and Sainz has generally gone along with that but this season seeing as he is getting kicked off the team I think Sainz will go all out </h6>
<h3>Max Verstappen</h3>
