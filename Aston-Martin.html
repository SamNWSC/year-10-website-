    <p>Aston Martin’s journey in Formula One is a blend of heritage and resurgence. The British car manufacturer first entered the sport in 1959 with the DBR4 chassis and its own engine, but after a lack of success, they withdrew after the 1960 season. Decades later, the iconic brand made a comeback to F1 in 2021, rebranded from the Racing Point F1 Team and utilizing customer Mercedes power units. Looking ahead, Aston Martin has announced a works partnership with Honda for power units starting in 2026. With Lawrence Stroll at the helm and drivers like Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll, the team is headquartered in Silverstone and is on a mission to carve out a new chapter of success in the pinnacle of motorsport</p>
