    <h1>My predictions for the 2024 season</h1>

    <h6>Personally I think Logan Sargeant will end the drivers championship in 20th this is because he did not perform very well last year and came 21st in the championship last year with the only other driver below him not being in Formula 1 this year.</h6>
    <h3>P19 Estaban Ocon</h3>

    <h6>This desicion is pretty bold but I think that alpine is going to be very weak this season as they are under a new team princapal and the car looked terrible in Bahrain</h6>
    <h3>P18 Pierre Gasly</h3>

    <h6>As with Ocon I think that Alpine is going to be very weak this season as it was a P19 and P20 qualifying for the alpines and they did not place much better only overtaking Bottas who had a pit issue and Logan Sargeant who crashed off</h6>
    <h3>P17 Valtteri Bottas</h3>

   <h6> I do not think Stake F1 is going to be a extremly competitive team this year. Also I think that Bottas may retire this season as Carlos Sainz may take his seat. This is all combined with Zhou having better race pace in bahrain </h6>
    <h3>P16 Kevin Magnussen</h3>

    <h6>I feel that Magnussen is going to do slightly better this season as the haas is not going to be the worst car by far but I still think that Magnussen is not going to do that well as he was knocked out in Q2 in Bahrain compared to his teamate who got to Q3  </h6>
