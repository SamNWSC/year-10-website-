    <p>The Visa Cash App RB Formula One Team, previously known as Scuderia AlphaTauri, is a rebranded F1 team competing in the 2024 season. This rebranding reflects a significant sponsorship deal with Visa, a global digital payment network, and Cash App, a platform for money exchange including cryptocurrency. The team, which has its roots in the former Minardi team, has been part of the Red Bull family since 2006, initially serving as a junior team before transitioning to a sister team status. For the 2024 season, the team fields drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Yuki Tsunoda, with Laurent Mekies as the team principal. Despite some criticism over its name change, the team aims to enhance its competitiveness in F1 with a new identity and a bold vision for the future</p>
